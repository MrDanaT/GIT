# Snake

This project is one of my first creations in the first year of learning code. It is 100% based on the populair [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)). It is written in [Visual Basic](https://docs.microsoft.com/nl-be/dotnet/visual-basic/getting-started/) and is a part of an assignment I got from school.

## Language

As a starter to the programming world, I've written everything in my native language, which is Dutch. I will not implement any translations as this project serves as an archive and throwback to my starting career rather than focusing on optimal code and efficiency.

## Run project

You can start my project as simple as openening it up in Visual Studio, and run it with the play button.

## Credits

This project is made by me with a little help of an ex-fellow student of my last field of study (Computer sciences).
